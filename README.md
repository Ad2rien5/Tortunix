# Tortunix

## Description 
**Tortunix** is a low-level programming langage, who can be compile to a assembly code throught this compiler. This compiler will be created without using compiler specific library.  
In the first place, it will focus on making this compiler work on Ubuntu, then some other portage.

## Objectif
This project has been created for educational purpose, to discover how compiler works. This explain why this project won't be using any specific library.  
Despite the eductational intent that have created this project, **Tortunix** is still meant to be a usable and viable programming langage to use.  

## Technology involved  
### OCaml
**OCaml** will be the main programming langage of this project as it will be use to programm the compiler.  
This programming langage is good for coding compiler because of it effective way of matching pattern. It is also powerful thanks to his compiler which is written in native code.
